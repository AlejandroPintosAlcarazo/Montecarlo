Estimating π Using Monte Carlo Method
Overview
This example demonstrates how to estimate the value of π using the Monte Carlo Method. By randomly sampling points within a square and counting how many fall inside a quarter circle, we can approximate π.

Method
Generate Random Points: Randomly distribute points within a unit square.
Count Points Inside the Circle: Determine how many points fall inside the quarter circle.
Estimate π: Use the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points to estimate π.
Results
Below is a visual representation of the Monte Carlo simulation for estimating π:
