Monte Carlo Method: A Simple Solution for Complex Problems
Overview
The Monte Carlo Method is a powerful computational algorithm that leverages repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It's particularly useful for solving deterministic problems that are too complex to tackle analytically. This repository demonstrates how the Monte Carlo Method can be used to estimate values such as œÄ and compute integrals.

Why Monte Carlo?
Versatility: Applicable in fields ranging from physics to finance.
Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
Robustness: Effective for complex problems where traditional methods fail.
Applications
Estimating œÄ: A classic "Hello World" example.
Calculating Integrals: Approximating complex integrals.
Crypto Portfolio Optimization: Simulating asset allocations to optimize a portfolio.

README for Estimating œÄ
Estimating œÄ Using Monte Carlo Method
Overview
This example demonstrates how to estimate the value of œÄ using the Monte Carlo Method. By randomly sampling points within a square and counting how many fall inside a quarter circle, we can approximate œÄ.

Method
Generate Random Points: Randomly distribute points within a unit square.
Count Points Inside the Circle: Determine how many points fall inside the quarter circle.
Estimate œÄ: Use the ratio of points inside the circle to the total number of points to estimate œÄ.
Results
Below is a visual representation of the Monte Carlo simulation for estimating œÄ:


README for Calculating Integrals
Calculating Integrals Using Monte Carlo Method
Overview
This example shows how to use the Monte Carlo Method to approximate the value of definite integrals. The method involves randomly sampling points within the integration bounds and using the average value to estimate the integral.

Method
Define the Function: Specify the function to be integrated.
Generate Random Points: Randomly sample points within the integration bounds.
Compute the Integral: Use the average value of the function at the sampled points to approximate the integral.
