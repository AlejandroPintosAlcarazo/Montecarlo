Monte Carlo Method: A Simple Solution for Complex Problems
Overview
The Monte Carlo Method is a powerful computational algorithm that leverages repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. It's particularly useful for solving deterministic problems that are too complex to tackle analytically. This repository demonstrates how the Monte Carlo Method can be used to estimate values such as π and compute integrals.

Why Monte Carlo?
Versatility: Applicable in fields ranging from physics to finance.
Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
Robustness: Effective for complex problems where traditional methods fail.
Applications
Estimating π: A classic "Hello World" example.
Calculating Integrals: Approximating complex integrals.
Crypto Portfolio Optimization: Simulating asset allocations to optimize a portfolio.
